I am a final-year undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur pursuing a 5-year dual degree (B.Tech Hons. + M.Tech) in Chemical Engineering with a Minor in Artificial Intelligence. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, materials science, and natural language processing.

I have authored 5 research papers spanning diverse domains including privacy-preserving NLP (CipherBERT), AI-driven tooling frameworks (RTaC), lunar elemental mapping using Chandrayaan-2 data, and materials discovery for solid-state batteries. My work has been published/accepted at IEEE TPS 2025, NSLP 2024, RAAI 2024, and is under review at ICARUS.

Currently, I am working on my Master's thesis with Prof. Somnath Ganguly, developing machine learning frameworks to accelerate the discovery of solid electrolytes for next-generation batteries.
